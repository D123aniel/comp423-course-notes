Dev Containers also provide a way to quickly get team members up and running by pre-defining dependencies, versions, tools, and configurations in a single file. They also work in isolation from your host machine, allowing developers to prevent conflicts between versions and dependencies. </p> <p>These benefits provided by Dev Containers ensure a smooth and reliable development experience, especially in collaborative settings.

To do so, we run <code>go build -o main</code> in our terminal. This produces a binary file <code>main</code>, which is an executable file that can be executed separately from Go's environment. To execute the file directly, run the command <code>./main</code>.</p> <p><code>run</code> vs <code>build</code></p> <p><code>go run</code> automatically compiles and executes the program. <code>go build</code> compiles but doesn't execute the program, instead creating a separate binary file. This is an executable file that can be run later independent of the GO environment. This allows for more portable binary files for sharing, and ensuring they work outside of this particular environment.</p> <p>Credits and Acknowledgements: https://comp423-25s.github.io/resources/MkDocs/tutorial/</p>"}]}
